# Broken Authentication and Session Management

Many websites require users to log in to access their data or engage with the websites services etc. More often than not, this is done using a username and password. With this information, a site will assign and send each logged-in visitor a unique session ID that serves as a key to the userâ€™s identity on the server.

When these bedrock systems are "broken" they can easily be exploited by threat actors. This vulnerability is extremely broad in nature with multiple attack vectors including dictionary attacks, XSS/XFS, side channel attacks, SQL injections and most types of phishing.

## Common examples of broken authentication and session management

1. Weak or [Common passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords) are allowed allowing dictionary brute force attacks
2. Weak or ineffective credential recovery/forgot-password processes which can be easily brute forced.
3. Exposed session ID's or session ID's that can be calculated or brute forced
4. Persistent session ID's are not properly invalidated during logout or a period of inactivity.
5. When re-authentication is not required for administrative or destructive processes
6. Inappropriate cacheing of session ID's
7. Predictable authentication tokens

## How to penetrate test for this vulnerability

1. Try to create a new user with simple or [Common passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords).
2. Write a script or a pen-testing application to brute force [Common passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords) and [common usernames](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Usernames).

## How to countermeasure this vulnerability

1. Enforce strong passwords
2. [Log](..\defensive_data_handling\README.md#Logging) all failed login attempts and implement failed login policies for example when multiple failed login attempts are detected from the same IP address or same username.
3. Implement a secure, server-side session management system that creates a new, random session ID with high complexity each time someone logs in. Ensure the session ID is not visible in the web page's URL, is kept safe, and is properly discarded following a user's logout, periods of inactivity, or after session timeouts. For example install and configure [Flask Session](https://flask-session.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
4. Implement [two factor authentication](.student_resources\two_factor_authentication).
5. Conduct regular [security audits and testing](.student_resources\security_testing_approaches).
6. Implement strong rate limiting for a login page. For example, install and configure [Flask Limiter](https://flask-limiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
